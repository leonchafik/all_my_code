Installation
============

Notes on how to install

##### GitHub (for latest version)
Pull the latest code directly from GitHub with the following command:  
`python -m pip install git+https://github.com/lukegre/all_my_tools.git`


##### GitHub (for developing)
For the most up to date version of all_my_tools, you can install directly from the online repository hosted on GitLab.

1. Clone all_my_tools to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/lukegre/all_my_tools`
2. Change to the parent directory of all_my_tools
3. Install glidertools with `pip install -e ./all_my_tools`. This will allow changes you make locally, to be reflected when you import the package in Python
